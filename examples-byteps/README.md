# BytePS Examples

This repo contains several examples to run [BytePS](https://github.com/bytedance/byteps/), including popular CV/NLP models implemented in TensorFlow/PyTorch/MXNet. You can use them to reproduce the end-to-end evaluation results in the [OSDI'20 paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/jiang) of BytePS.

## Usage

You should [install BytePS](https://github.com/bytedance/byteps/#quick-start) before anything else. 

A `run.sh` is provided for each example to demonstrate the basic usage. It does not set up the necessary enviroment variables needed by BytePS. Therefore, before you run these examples, we recommend you read [this tutorial](https://github.com/bytedance/byteps/blob/master/docs/step-by-step-tutorial.md) for detailed guidelines on launching BytePS. Usually it will be easier to get started on the simple example in that tutorial, and then try more complicated examples in this repo.

Read the [best-practice doc](https://github.com/bytedance/byteps/blob/master/docs/best-practice.md) for improving the training performance after you have launched BytePS successfully.

We also provide options to switch to Horovod for performance comparison. To do so, you should change `bpslaunch` to MPI-based command (see [Horovod tutorial](https://github.com/horovod/horovod#running-horovod)), and then change the value of related environment variable (usually `DISTRIBUTED_FRAMEWORK`) or python trailing argument as noted in each `run.sh`.

## Acknowledgement

Some of our examples rely on public repos, including:
- https://github.com/tensorflow/models
- https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp
- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
- https://github.com/znxlwm/UGATIT-pytorch

We use most of their code while slightly modify the communication part in order to use BytePS.
